MoneyTracker Pro is a full-stack expense tracking application designed to help users manage their personal finances in a simple, organized, and visually intuitive way. The application allows users to record income and expense transactions with detailed information such as category, amount, and date, while automatically calculating total income, total expenses, and net balance in real time. It features a clean and modern user interface with light and dark theme support, making it comfortable to use in different environments. Interactive charts and financial insights provide a clear overview of spending patterns, category-wise expenses, monthly comparisons, and budget tracking, helping users make informed financial decisions. 

The application also includes powerful search and filter options, enabling users to quickly find specific transactions, along with the ability to export transaction data as a professionally formatted PDF report. Unlike basic client-side trackers, MoneyTracker Pro uses a backend server built with Node.js and Express, and stores data securely in an SQLite database, ensuring persistence and reliability beyond browser storage. 

This architecture makes the project scalable, maintainable, and suitable for future enhancements such as user authentication, cloud database integration, and deployment as a production-ready personal finance management tool.
